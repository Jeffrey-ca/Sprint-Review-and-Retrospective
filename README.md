# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User stories are used to layout different users needs and wants with a program to try and help the development team know what the are creating.
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I like the sprint process and the story boards that allow for progress to be shown and tracked easily. I like these because they work well together to say get this amount of work done in a certain time.
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in software development is dependant on being able to communicate well and ask questions to understand what is going on.
